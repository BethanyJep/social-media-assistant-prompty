# Social Media Assistant Prompty

Using prompty, you can easily standardize your prompt and execute it into a single asset. Prompty brings the focus of building LLM apps to prompts, giving you visibility and allowing you to easily integrate with other orchestrators and tools available. It goes beyond just calling the API and adds in additional configurations using markdown format to create and manage your prompts.
